This project exists purely to get autogenerated files. There isn't a good way to run auto generated tasks from shared projects currently.
Rather than put them in a consumer, creating a dummy project and including the relevant files in the Common project so that they show up
in the consuming projects.

Updating or rebuilding this project will force update the time stamp constants and the resultant version numbers.

Note that this project has to be portable to allow for the resx generation to work correctly for other portable projects.
(Due to the need for GetType extensions)
